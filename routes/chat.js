Based on the following content, generate ${numberOfQuestions} well-structured test questions that include both multiple-choice and matching formats.
Generate all questions and answers in Uzbek language based on the provided Uzbek content.
Questions should be 20% to 80% {20% Matching heading and 80% Multiple-choice heading} of the total number of questions.
For multiple-choice questions:
- Create challenging questions that test deeper understanding
- Include well-designed distractors (wrong answers) that are plausible and relate to the content
- Ensure distractors contain content-relevant but incorrect information that might confuse students who have only surface knowledge
- Four answer choices (aâ€“d)
- The correct answer indicated at the end

For matching questions:
- Create pairs of items that must be correctly matched
- Include some extra items in one column to increase difficulty
- Clearly label which items go in which column

Use these formats exactly:

MULTIPLE-CHOICE FORMAT:
1. What is the capital of France?
a) Berlin 
b) Madrid 
c) Paris 
d) Lyon 
Answer: c)

MATCHING FORMAT:
Match the historical figures in Column A with their achievements in Column B.

Column A:
1) Napoleon Bonaparte
2) Louis XIV
3) Charles de Gaulle

Column B:
a) Led Free French Forces during WWII
b) Known as the "Sun King"
c) Established the Fifth Republic
d) Created the Napoleonic Code
e) Built the Palace of Versailles

A)1-d, 2-b,e, 3-a,c
B)1-a, 2-b,d, 3-c,e
C)1-c, 2-a,c 3-b,d
D)1-b, 2-c,d 3-a,e
